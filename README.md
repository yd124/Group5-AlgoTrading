Stock Selection: ????



After Yuqing selects around 30 pairs from the performance of individual stocks, 
Qiaofeng uses the log ploting graph to verify our choices and narrow down the number of pairs to 17.

Pair trading strategy:
Yuqing was working on daily trading at 10AM using equity's hour data in OnePairTradingStrategy
Qiaofeng was working on hour trading.

Yuqing and Qiaofeng combine their work and develop their multiple pair trading strategy without slippage model in (Old)MultiplePairTradingStrategy.
They improve strategy's performance (with or without slippage model) in (New)MultiplePairTradingStrategy.
